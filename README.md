# BlissRoms Bug Reports

This is an empty repository to be used for BlissRoms source-related bug reports.

To file a bug report, please go to the "Issues" tab and submit a report. Thank you!

## Before submitting a bug report

**Is the bug specific to your device? If so, this is not the correct place to file a bug report. Please file the bug report under your device's respective repository.** For example, if you have a problem with your Nexus 5X, and you would like your maintainer to look at it, file an issue at https://github.com/BlissRoms-Devices/android_device_lge_bullhead.

**Do you have a logcat?** If it's a system crash or some other crashing issue, these problems are often hard or downright impossible to fix without proper logs of what happened. You may find that your bug report was closed due to lack of actionable information - if that happens, please add more information to the report as a comment and we will re-open it if we deem it actionable.

**Is it not a bug report?** Please ONLY use this repository for bug reports. Do not post user help questions here. For user help, go to one of our Telegram chats and we will be happy to help you. In addition, do not post requests for information from developers like ETA. Your report will be removed and you may be banned from filing more reports.

**Are you editing the template?** Please try NOT to edit the template unless you believe your bug is sufficiently unique, or if it's a type of bug that does not require certain sections (for example, if you are reporting a typo in one of our applications, you don't need to necessarily include a logcat, but just a screenshot). These cases are OK. But if you are submitting a bug report about a crash, giving us a screenshot of the crash is not really going to be helpful.

**Is it nice?** Do not post threatening or harrassing bug reports. You will be banned immediately from participating. Be nice to others and the developers and the maintainers of Team Bliss. Any form of rudeness is NOT tolerated.

Have fun and let's go squash some bugs!
