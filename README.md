# BlissRoms Bug Reports

This is an empty repository to be used for BlissRoms Project-related bug reports.

To file a bug report, please go to the "Issues" tab and submit a report. Thank you!

## Before submitting a bug report

**Do you have a logcat?** If it's a system crash or some other crashing issue, these problems are often hard or downright impossible to fix without proper logs of what happened. You may find that your bug report was closed due to lack of actionable information - if that happens, please add more information to the report as a comment and we will re-open it if we deem it actionable.

**Is it not a bug report?** Please ONLY use this repository for bug reports. Do not post user help questions here. For user help, go to one of our Telegram chats and we will be happy to help you. In addition, do not post requests for information from developers like ETA. Your report will be removed and you may be banned from filing more reports.

**Is it nice?** Do not post threatening or harrassing bug reports. You will be banned immediately from participating. Be nice to others and the developers and the maintainers of Team Bliss. Any form of rudeness is NOT tolerated.

Have fun and let's go squash some bugs!
